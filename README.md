## ACCOUNTING WORKFLOW

1. Client Information Collection:
    Store client contact information, including state or country, in the client profile within Odoo ERP.

2. Product vs. Service Tagging:
    Use tags to differentiate between products (goods) and services. Services are tagged as "No Tax".

3. Tax Rate Determination:
    Utilize a software or plugin to automatically determine the correct tax rate based on the client's state or country.

4. Inventory Management for Services:
    Services are inventoried under a "No Tax" category to ensure they are not taxed.

5. Vendor Tax Payments:
    Track taxes paid on vendor purchases, specifically for Nevada state tax, within Odoo ERP.

6. Tax Details in Customer Profile:
    Build tax details into the customer profile for accurate tax calculations during invoicing.

7. Invoicing Process:
    Invoices are generated using services and items in the inventory, ensuring tags are correctly applied.
    Tom checks and approves invoices to ensure accuracy before sending them out.

8. Accounts Management:
    Use three checking accounts for payroll and expenses.
    Use a savings account for profit and taxes.
    Taxes paid on invoices are automatically transferred to the savings account.
    Remaining amounts after taxes and expenses are transferred to the savings account as profit.

9. Tracking Damages/Losses:
    Damages and losses are tracked for writeoffs in Odoo ERP.

10. Compliance and Reporting:
     Implement a compliance and reporting policy (recommendation to follow).

11. Integration with Odoo ERP:
     Use outofthebox functions, plugins, and custom solutions to integrate all processes into Odoo ERP.


 ### Recommendations for Compliance and Reporting Policy

1. Compliance:
    Ensure all financial transactions are recorded accurately and timely.
    Maintain detailed records of all sales, purchases, tax payments, and expenses.
    Regularly audit financial records to ensure compliance with state and federal tax laws.
    Stay updated with changes in tax laws and regulations.

2. Reporting:
    Generate monthly, quarterly, and annual financial reports.
    Include detailed breakdowns of revenues, expenses, taxes paid, and profits.
    Use Odoo ERPâ€™s reporting tools to automate report generation and ensure consistency.

## AUTOMATED PURCHASE ORDER WORKFLOW

1. Order Received:
    When a new order is placed, it is immediately received and logged into the system.

2. Collect Customer & Order Details:
    The necessary customer information and order details are collected to ensure accurate processing and fulfillment.

3. Check Inventory:
    The system checks the current inventory levels for the ordered items.
    If the items are in stock, the process moves directly to Package and Ship.
    If the items are out of stock or low stock (inventory below two units for any variant), the workflow initiates the creation of a purchase order.

4. Create Purchase Order:
    The system automatically generates a purchase order for the necessary items that are either out of stock or below the minimum stock level.

5. Notify CEO for Purchase Confirmation:
    A notification is sent to the CEO to review and confirm the purchase order. This step ensures that all purchases are authorized at the highest level of the organization.

6. Confirm Purchase of Goods:
    Upon receiving confirmation from the CEO, the purchase order is finalized and the goods are ordered from the supplier.

7. Receive Purchase Order:
    Once the ordered goods are delivered, they are received into the inventory system, updating stock levels accordingly.

8. Allocate Items to Departments:
    The received items are then allocated to the appropriate departments based on the order requirements.

9. Embroidery / Screen Printing / Vinyl Heat Press:
    The items are processed through the necessary decoration departments, which may include embroidery, screen printing, or vinyl heat press.

10. Order Fulfilled:
     After the decoration process is completed, the order is marked as fulfilled.

11. Package and Ship:
     The completed order is packaged and shipped to the customer, concluding the workflow.
